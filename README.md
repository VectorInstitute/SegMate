SegMate: A Segment Anything Model Toolkit

## Description

This repository is a toolkit for using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta AI. It is capable of accurately "cutting out" any object from an image with just a single click.

SAM is a promptable segmentation system that exhibits zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects and images, eliminating the need for additional training. By providing prompts that specify what needs to be segmented in an image, SAM can perform a wide range of segmentation tasks without requiring additional training.

The design of SAM is highly flexible and enables seamless integration with other systems. It has been trained on millions of images and masks using a model-in-the-loop "data engine" approach. Researchers iteratively annotated images and updated the model, resulting in SAM's advanced capabilities and understanding of objects.

SAM was trained on over 1.1 billion segmentation masks collected from approximately 11 million licensed and privacy-preserving images. The dataset was built using SAM's ambiguity-aware design and a grid of points, allowing it to automatically annotate new images.

SAM's efficiency is achieved by decoupling the model into a one-time image encoder and a lightweight mask decoder. The mask decoder can run in a web browser, completing segmentation tasks within a few milliseconds per prompt.

## Features

- API for easy inference with SAM, supporting bounding box, points, and text prompts
- Automatic masking without the need for prompts
- API for zero-shot image segmentation with Grounding Dino using text prompts
- API for finetuning SAM on custom datasets

## Usage

To get started, follow the installation instructions in the [Installation]() guide. Once you have the toolkit set up, you can refer to the [API Documentation]() for detailed usage instructions and examples.
